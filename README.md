# py_art_me


py_art_me is a collection of sources related to making art programmatically. 

Research question : How great Python is for art?

### Hypothesis: 
```1. Great if you newbie or/and cannot code in another language. 
2. Great since it is easy to debug and experiment.
3. Great regardless. 
4. Fine but not best language for doing art. Use Java/C++/Kotlin/JavaScript or paper and brush instead. 
```
